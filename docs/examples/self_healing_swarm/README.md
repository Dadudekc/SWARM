# Self-Healing Swarm Template

This minimal example demonstrates how to launch a small Dream.OS swarm with automatic recovery enabled. The `start_swarm.py` script boots a default agent controller and enables periodic restart logic.

Use this template as a starting point for integrating Dream.OS into your Cursor projects or other environments.
