# Quarantine Cleanup Checklist

## Overview
This document tracks the cleanup process for quarantined tests. Each test will be evaluated, fixed if possible, and either restored to the main test suite or archived.

## Test Status Summary
- Total Quarantined Tests: 65
- Platform Impact: Windows-specific (16 tests)
- Last Review: 2024-06-03T06:45:00Z

   - Priority: Medium
   - Action: Review file encoding and format handling

### Phase 2: File Handle Management
4. [ ] `test_write_log`
   - Issue: Windows file handle management
   - Fix: Implement proper file handle lifecycle
   - Priority: High
   - Action: Review file handle closing logic

5. [ ] `test_read_logs`
   - Issue: Windows file locking

   - Action: Review read/write synchronization

6. [ ] `test_batch_processing`
   - Issue: Windows file handle management in batch
   - Fix: Implement batch file handle management
   - Priority: High
   - Action: Review batch operation file handling

### Phase 3: Configuration Tests
7. [ ] `test_config_defaults`
   - Issue: Log directory path mismatch
   - Fix: Update path handling
   - Priority: Medium
   - Action: Review path normalization

8. [ ] `test_config_custom_values`
   - Issue: Log directory path mismatch
   - Fix: Update path handling
   - Priority: Medium
   - Action: Review path configuration

### Phase 4: Basic Functionality
9. [ ] `test_basic_logging`

10. [ ] `test_log_levels`
    - Issue: Log entry counting and filtering
    - Fix: Fix entry counting logic
    - Priority: Medium
    - Action: Review level filtering

## Cleanup Rules

### For Each Test:
1. [ ] Run test in isolation
2. [ ] Document current behavior
3. [ ] Apply fix if identified
4. [ ] Re-test after fix
5. [ ] Update documentation
6. [ ] Move to appropriate directory

### Decision Tree:
- If test passes after fix → Move to main suite
- If test needs platform-specific handling → Add platform markers
- If test is deprecated → Move to archive
- If test is low-value → Consider removal

## Progress Tracking

### Completed
- None yet

### In Progress
- Phase 1: Windows File System Tests

### Pending
- Phase 2: File Handle Management
- Phase 3: Configuration Tests
- Phase 4: Basic Functionality

## Notes
- All fixes should be documented in the devlog
- Platform-specific issues should be clearly marked
- Test moves should be tracked in git history
- Regular updates to this checklist as progress is made

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Phase 1 tests
2. Document all findings in devlog
3. Update test status after each phase
4. Review and adjust priorities as needed
