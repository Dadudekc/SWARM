# Phase 4 Roadmap: Toward Closed-Loop Autonomy

This document defines the next evolution of Dream.OS autonomy. It summarizes the current challenges preventing fully self-run agents, proposes architectural solutions, and outlines Phase 4+ milestones to achieve a closed-loop automation system.

## Top Bottlenecks

1. **Agent Drift & Context Loss**
 - Long‑running agents gradually forget earlier instructions or task boundaries.
  - Lack of persistent short/long‑term memory makes recovery difficult after a restart.
  - Missing heartbeat checks mean dead agents go unnoticed until failures accumulate.
2. **Failure Recovery & Self‑Healing Limitations**
   - Agents crash or loop on the same error when prompts fail to produce valid actions.
   - Manual restarts waste developer time and break the dream of a self‑steering swarm.
3. **Static Resource Allocation & Scaling Bottlenecks**
   - Fixed CPU and memory budgets cause bottlenecks during heavy workloads.
   - Idle agents waste resources because nothing releases them when demand drops.

## Proposed Solutions

- **Self‑Healing Prompts**
  - Recursive prompt regeneration with automatic retry layers and rollback checkpoints.
  - When repeated failures occur, the agent injects diagnostic hints and resumes from the last stable state.

- **Multi‑Agent Escalation**
  - Failed tasks flow to a supervisor that analyzes context from multiple agents.
  - Work can be reassigned or split across the swarm to avoid deadlocks.

- **Dynamic Resource Scaling**
  - Modularize agents so they can spawn or terminate in containers on demand.
  - Integrate orchestration hooks to request more CPU or memory and release resources when loads drop.

## Phase 4+ Milestones

1. **4.1 Memory Nexus V2**
   - Live memory injection for agents using SQLite and JSON snapshots.
2. **4.1b Failure Analytics Pipeline**
   - Centralized logging of agent errors and prompt failures.
   - Real-time dashboard charts error frequency, type, and resolution rate.
   - Provides swarm health metrics for escalation and triage.
3. **4.2 Prompt Healer + Auto‑Regenerator**
   - Automatic prompt repair and retry logic with analytics on failure trends.
4. **4.3 Dynamic Agent Swarm Scaling**
   - On‑demand container spawning and resource balancing across the swarm.
5. **4.4 Global Orchestration Layer**
   - A self‑steering control tower that coordinates agent hand‑offs and escalation.
6. **4.5 Autonomous Market Strategy AI**
   - Real‑world showcase of fully autonomous agents iterating on product strategy.
7. **5.0 Closed‑Loop Autonomy**
   - Combine memory fusion, self‑healing prompts, escalation, and scaling for long‑running unattended operation.

These steps advance Dream.OS toward a resilient automation platform capable of running complex workflows with minimal oversight.

## Phase 4.1 Validation
- Install test dependencies with `pip install -r requirements-test.txt`.
- Run `pytest tests/unit/analytics tests/unit/memory` to verify the Failure Analytics Pipeline and SQLite memory.
- Persistent memory is confirmed by instantiating `SQLiteMemory` twice and ensuring stored data is retained across instances.
