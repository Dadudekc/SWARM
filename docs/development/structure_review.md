# Codebase Structure Review

This document highlights a few simple cleanup tasks discovered during a quick sweep of the repository.

## Duplicate Files

- `tools/core/monitor/drift_detector.py` and `tools/core/monitor/loop_drift_detector.py` were identical. The former has been removed in favour of the latter.

## Empty Directories

- `dreamos_dir_ops/` contained only an empty placeholder file and has been removed.

## Small Directories

Several top level folders (`errors/`, `memory/`) currently hold a single file. These could be folded into `data/` or another shared location to reduce clutter in the project root.

## Merge Scripts and Tools

The `scripts/` and `tools/` directories provide various maintenance utilities. Consolidating them under a single `tools/` directory could simplify discovery of helper scripts as suggested in `AGENTS.md`.
