# Dream.OS Feature Analysis and LLM Prompt Guide

This guide summarizes the most important pieces of Dream.OS and explains how they fit together.  Each section highlights the primary modules and design choices so another developer or language model can reproduce the architecture.  At the end you'll find a set of prompts that can be fed to an LLM to iteratively recreate the core features.

### Code Duplication Analysis
- Utilities in `agent_tools/swarm/analyzers` scan for duplicate code and config.
- Helps keep the project maintainable by highlighting redundant logic.

### Additional Modules
- `crime_report_generator/` demonstrates a specialized standalone module.
- `tools/life_os_dashboard.py` offers a personal dashboard for quick agent
  access and monitoring.

## Implementation Logic by Feature

### Agent Control
1. `AgentManager` keeps a dictionary of `agent_id -> subprocess` to track running agents.
2. Agents start via `start_agent()` which launches their Python entry point and creates a mailbox in `runtime/mailbox/<agent>`.
3. Monitoring threads check process health and use `agent_restarter.py` to auto-restart crashed agents.
4. Commands like resume or verify write JSON messages to `inbox.json` and wait for acknowledgements.

### Messaging System
1. Messages store `mode`, `content`, and `timestamp` fields.
2. The `CellPhone` class writes messages to each agent's inbox and polls for reply files.
3. Sequence numbers prevent duplicate processing and old messages are pruned.
4. `CaptainPhone` wraps `CellPhone` for high-priority routing.

### Task Management
1. `TaskManager` loads definitions from `config/agent_comms/<agent>.json`.
2. Each task contains an ID, priority, and dependency list.
3. Agents call `start_task(task_id)` to update history and progress.
4. Completed tasks are archived and metrics updated for Dreamscribe.

### Logging and Monitoring
1. Operations write through `LogManager.write()` which rotates files daily.
2. Metrics counters are incremented with each entry and exported to Prometheus.
3. Discord commands and the dashboard can stream the latest logs.

### Bridge Architecture
1. `BridgeManager` maintains asynchronous connections to external services.
2. Each bridge inherits from `BaseBridge` with `connect`, `send`, and `disconnect` hooks.
3. Health checks reconnect failing bridges and validate authentication tokens.

### Dreamscribe Narrative Memory
1. `Dreamscribe` parses logs into `MemoryFragment` objects.
2. Fragments link into `NarrativeThread` histories that agents can query.

### UI Dashboard
1. `AgentDashboard` is a PyQt window composed of dockable panels showing agent status and logs.
2. Buttons trigger the same operations as CLI utilities for consistent behavior.

### Browser Automation
1. `StealthBrowser` wraps `undetected-chromedriver` with anti-detection headers.
2. Cookies in `runtime/browser_cookies/` allow session reuse and scripted logins.

### Security & Duplication Checks
1. Access rules reside in `config/security/policies.yaml`.
2. `agent_tools/swarm/analyzers` scans the codebase for duplicate files or settings.

## Example LLM Prompts

    ```

11. **Testing Harness and Configuration**
    ```text
    Provide a pytest-based test harness that mocks external services and loads agent settings from YAML files. Include fixtures for the TaskManager and BridgeManager so features can be validated in isolation.
    ```

12. **Lean Beta Deployment**
    ```text
    Combine the above modules into a minimal CLI entrypoint that launches an agent swarm, starts the bridge server, and exposes metrics. Document the environment variables required for local deployment.
    ```

Using these prompts sequentially encourages the LLM to build out the major Dream.OS features in manageable steps. Each step focuses on an isolated subsystem so that the resulting PRD can be organized feature by feature.
