# Dream.OS Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Purpose
This document outlines the key requirements and goals for the Dream.OS project. It serves as a roadmap for ongoing development and helps ensure features align with the overall vision.

## Vision
Dream.OS is a swarm‑driven AI platform where multiple autonomous agents coordinate tasks, log activity, and can integrate with external services like Discord. The platform should provide reliable agent orchestration, robust communication, extensible task management, and rich logging/monitoring tools.

## Stakeholders
- **Project Maintainers** – oversee development and ensure consistency
- **Developers** – build new agents, features, and integrations
- **End Users** – run agents locally or via hosted services
- **Community Contributors** – extend the platform through pull requests

## Goals
1. **Agent Management**
   - Lifecycle control: start, stop, monitor, and restart agents
   - Auto‑resume after idle timeout
   - Support custom agent implementations via a base SDK
2. **Messaging System**
   - Central message bus with delivery confirmation and retry logic
   - Specialized channels for agent‑to‑agent and Captain interactions
   - Message history stored in `dreamos/data/message_history.json`
3. **Task Management**
   - Create and assign tasks with priority levels and dependencies
   - Track task progress and status in real time
   - Provide command line tools for task monitoring
4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Centralized logging with rotation and archival
   - Discord integration for log summaries and alerts
   - Optional GUI dashboard for viewing logs
5. **Social Media Automation**
   - Platform strategies for Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, LinkedIn, and StockTwits
   - Scheduling, posting, and engagement tracking
6. **Extensibility**
   - Modular design so new features can be added without major refactoring
   - Documented SDK for building custom agents or integrations
8. **Testing & Quality**
   - Unit, integration, and end‑to‑end tests in the `tests/` directory
   - Code style enforced via formatting and linting tools
   - Continuous Integration workflow for pull requests

## Non‑Goals
- Building a fully managed SaaS platform (beyond providing guidelines in documentation)
- Implementing advanced machine learning models within this repository

## Milestones
1. **MVP Agent Framework** *(complete)*
   - Basic agent lifecycle management
   - Messaging infrastructure and logging
2. **Discord Control Interface** *(complete)*
   - Commands for listing agents, sending messages, and monitoring status
   - Logging summaries via Discord
3. **Social Modules** *(complete)*
   - Integrate social media posting flows
   - Provide configuration files and tests
4. **Enhanced Monitoring** *(complete)*
   - GUI dashboard and extended metrics collection
   - Alerting and recovery guides
5. **Scalability & Hardening**
   - Containerize agents with Docker
   - Setup metrics endpoint and Grafana dashboard
   - Apply security hardening and sandboxing

## Success Metrics
- Agents can run continuously with minimal manual intervention
- Tasks are tracked and updated through the CLI or Discord interface
- Logs show clear event histories and rotate without data loss
- Community contributions follow the documented guides and pass the test suite
