## Coverage Summary

### Critical Paths
- ✓ Main execution loop
- ✓ Result processing pipeline
- ✓ Error recovery chain
- ✓ Configuration management
- ✓ Resource cleanup

### Intentionally Skipped
- ✗ Stress test scenarios
- ✗ Load testing paths
- ✗ Performance benchmarks
- ✗ Memory leak detection
- ✗ Long-running stability tests

## Test Implementation Status

### Basic Tests (`test_runner_core.py`)
- ✓ Initialization tests
- ✓ Start/stop tests
- ✓ Basic iteration tests
- ✓ Result handling tests
- ✓ Timeout tests
- ✓ Error handling tests

### Advanced Tests (`test_runner_advanced.py`)
- ✓ Config loading tests
- ✓ Test execution tests
- ✓ Failure parsing tests
- ✓ Concurrent processing tests
- ✓ Cancellation tests
- ✓ Error recovery tests

## Coverage Gaps (Non-Critical)
- ✗ Memory usage monitoring
- ✗ Performance profiling
- ✗ Resource leak detection
- ✗ Long-term stability
- ✗ Edge case handling

## Recommendations
1. Core functionality is well covered
2. Critical paths are tested
3. Error handling is verified
4. Configuration management is validated
5. Resource cleanup is confirmed

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to fixture consolidation (Option C)
2. No immediate coverage gaps requiring attention
3. Stress testing can be added in future if needed
