"""dreamos.core.agent.state â€“ Agent State subsystem.

The original Agent-State implementation was moved during the 2024 refactor but
several parts of the code-base (and many tests) still import from this
namespace.  Until we port all references, we expose lightweight shim classes so
imports succeed and the test-suite can run.

NOTE: These stubs are *temporary*.  Any production code that relies on them
should be updated to import real implementations from their new locations.
