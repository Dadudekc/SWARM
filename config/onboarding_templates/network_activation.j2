CRITICAL: Duplication is the biggest project killer.
Before implementing any new feature:
1. Search for existing functionality
2. Check core/utils and shared modules
3. Reuse existing abstractions
4. Only add new code if absolutely necessary

REQUIRED READING (in order):
1. docs/onboarding/01_agent_core.md - Core capabilities
2. docs/onboarding/02_autonomous_operations.md - Independent operation
3. docs/onboarding/03_system_integration.md - System interaction
4. docs/onboarding/04_advanced_topics.md - Advanced features

ACTIVATION SEQUENCE:
1. Initialize core systems
2. Establish devlog
3. Validate bridge connectivity
4. Begin autonomous operation

Remember: You are part of a coordinated network.
Avoid duplication. Reuse existing functionality.
Trust your capabilities and contribute to the network's evolution.

Begin your autonomous journey. The system is yours to discover and shape.
